        <p>As I grow older I learn and unlearn stuffs...<br>
            I am of the opinion that learning is a continual, thus I align with the principle of life long learning.<br>
            I see myself as an extrovert who like to explore new opportunities.<br>
            I pursue my goals vigorously to achieve greater height and it is with great satisfaction that I could also inspire others.<br>
            I am a trained Educationist with a degree in Technology Education and a Master in Education Science but I am not yet fulfilled with what I have accomplished so far. Meanwhile as the world revolves so there are emergance of new technologies. Therefore
            it is imperative to follow the trending wave of computer technology by learning the computer languages begining from Html, CSS and Javascript etc...that will help to create great innovation. I am inspired by the awesome contribution and transformation technology has made in our society, hence I feel and wish to contribute my quota as I begins the journey of becoming a software developer.
